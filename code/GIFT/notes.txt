Measuring ROM
size test

Latency: Latency denotes the number of clock cycles required to
compute each plaintext/ciphertext block.

Memory: Memory includes the RAM and ROM required by the
lightweight ciphers, typically measured in bytes. RAM stores interme-
diate values during computation, while ROM stores static data such as
code and keys.

Throughput: Throughput refers to the number of bits processed per
second by encryption/decryption at a given frequency F. Throughput
T is computed as: T = F Ã— B
                        N
where B is the block size in bits, and N is the number of clock cycles per
block. The common hardware frequency is 100 kHz, and the software
frequency is 4 MHz. Conventional ciphers offer higher throughput but
require more energy and gate equivalent costs. Lightweight ciphers aim
to provide higher throughput under constrained resources.

Efficiency: Efficiency evaluates the relationship between perfor-
mance and implementation cost, categorized into hardware and soft-
ware efficiency. Generally, higher efficiency values are preferable.
Software efficiency follows:
E = T
    s
where T is throughput in kbps and S is the code size in kB.
